# Project Euler Problems

This is a collection of my solutions to a series of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) mathematical and coding problems encoded in Python.

The solutions are consolidated into Jupyter notebooks containing problems as sets of 10.

The [Frequently Used Functions](./Frequently%20Used%20Functions.ipynb) file is a collection of useful self-defined Python functions that appear frequently in my solutions.
